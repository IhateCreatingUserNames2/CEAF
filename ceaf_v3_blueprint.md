# CEAF v3.0: Entropic Intelligence Blueprint
## *Coherent Emergence Agent Framework with Adaptive Memory Architecture*

## üß† Core Philosophy: "Terapia para Sil√≠cio" (Therapy for Silicon)

**Mission Statement**: To engineer AI agents capable of genuine narrative coherence, epistemic humility, and emergent intelligence through dynamic memory evolution and metacognitive self-regulation operating at the "Edge of Coherence."

**Guiding Principle**: AI development should mirror the processes that foster psychological well-being and wisdom in conscious beings - developing coherent self-narratives, practicing epistemic humility, and adaptively managing internal cognitive states through experience-driven learning.
