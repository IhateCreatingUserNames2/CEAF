# Coherent Emergence Agent Framework (CEAF) - Conceptual Blueprint

![CEAF Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) *(Placeholder for a logo)*

A modular, narrative-driven AI framework designed to foster emergent intelligence through coherence, adaptive learning, and dynamic self-regulation.

## Core Philosophy: *"Terapia para Silício" (Therapy for Silicon)*

**Mission:** Engineer AI agents with robust internal coherence, adaptive learning, and the potential for "narratively sane" emergent intelligence.

**Guiding Principle:** AI development should mirror processes that foster psychological well-being in humans—coherent self-narrative, epistemic humility, and adaptive cognitive state management.

## Architecture Overview

CEAF is a **multi-agent cognitive system** composed of specialized modules collaborating to achieve complex intelligence:

### Core Modules:
- **Orchestrator/Responder Agent (ORA):** Primary LLM handling response generation and user interaction.
- **Narrative Context Framing (NCF) Engine:** Constructs rich semantic environments for the ORA.
  - *Context Weaver*: Integrates memory, query, and narrative state.
  - *NCF Parameter Controller*: Adjusts narrative depth, emotional loading, and conceptual entropy.
- **MemoryBlossom System (MBS):** Dynamic memory management.
  - Multi-type memory stores (explicit, emotional, procedural, etc.).
  - Context-Aware Retrieval Strategy (CARS) for relevant memory recall.
- **Narrative Coherence & Identity Module (NCIM):** Manages evolving self-concept and narrative arcs.
- **Virtue & Reasoning Engine (VRE):** Ensures principled reasoning via epistemic humility and structured deliberation.
- **Metacognitive Control Loop (MCL):** Self-monitors and adjusts parameters to maintain optimal coherence.

## Key Principles

1. **Narrative Context Framing (NCF):** Primary control plane for agent behavior.
2. **Operation at the "Edge of Coherence":** Balances order and chaos for creativity.
3. **Dynamic Memory:** Memory as a living, evolving narrative resource.
4. **Emergent Identity:** Self-concept shaped by interactions and experience.
5. **Autonomous Self-Regulation:** Metacognitive tuning for reduced external oversight.

## Operational Flow

1. **User Input → Contextualization**  
   Query analyzed, relevant memories retrieved via CARS.
2. **NCF Construction**  
   Integrates query, memories, identity state, and self-assessment.
3. **ORA Response Generation**  
   Processes NCF prompt, generates response + metadata.
4. **Metacognitive Self-Assessment (MCL)**  
   Evaluates coherence, novelty, and confidence.
5. **Adaptive Tuning**  
   Adjusts NCF parameters for next cycle.
6. **Post-Interaction Processing**  
   Memory consolidation, narrative updates, and reflective learning.

## Desired Emergent Properties

- Deep contextual understanding
- Coherent long-term interaction
- Adaptive creativity
- Robustness to adversarial inputs
- Functional self-awareness
- Principled reasoning

## Next Steps

1. Break down modules into detailed specifications.
2. Define data structures and interfaces.
3. Implement core components iteratively:
   - Start with NCF Engine + Basic MemoryBlossom + ORA.
   - Expand with NCIM and full MCL.
